### Github and Debugging

#### Objective
Students will learn general software engineering practices and will be able
to navigate Git, have more available debugging tools at their disposal,
and learn the basics of exception handling. 

#### Pre-Work

#### Do Now (Morning)

Create a new Java class to do the following string operations:
* Reverse - "Quispe" -> "epsiuQ"
* Uppercase words - "i love java" -> "I Love Java"
* Reverse words - "Java Love I" -> "I Love Java"

#### Git and Github

*Git* is a version control system. *Github* is a very popular website for storing git repositories and collaborating.

> Exercise: Partner with the other person at your table.

> Part I: Fork and Pull
> 1. Create a repository on Github.
> 1. Clone the repository locally, add the Do Now, and push the change to Github.
> 1. Fork your partner's repository.
> 1. Clone the fork of your partner's repository locally.
> 1. Set the upstream to your partner's repository.
> 1. Create a new branch and make changes to the file in your partner's repository.
> 1. Commit and push this change to Github.
> 1. Open a pull request to your partner's repository master.
> 1. Code review the pull request from your partner.
> 1. Respond to all the changes requested on your pull request (either make the change or push back), and push your changes.
> 1. Accept your partner's pull request.

> Part II: Merge Conflict
> 1. Make your partner a collaborator on your repository.
> 1. Sync your local clone of your repository to origin master.
> 1. Clone your partner's repository locally.
> 1. Make changes to the file in your partner's repository and push.
> 1. Make changes to the file in your own repository and commit.
> 1. Before pushing, sync to origin master.
> 1. Resolve any merge conflicts.
> 1. Push your changes to your repository.

> Part III: Shared repository
> 1. Sync your local clone of your partner's repository to origin master.
> 1. Create a new branch on your partner's repository.
> 1. Push this branch to Github.
> 1. Make changes to the file on this branch and push.
> 1. Open a pull request from this branch to master.
> 1. Code review your partner's pull request on your repository.
> 1. Respond to all comments on your partner's code review on your pull request (either make changes or push back) and push your changes.
> 1. Go back and forth code reviewing and responding to comments until all comments are resolved.
> 1. If comments can't be resolved, ask a third party to weigh in on your pull requst.
> 1. Once all comments are resolved, accept your partner's pull request.
> 1. Sync your local clones of your repositories to origin master, and delete all resolved branches.

#### Do Now (Afternoon)

Find the pull request for your reviewee from this week's code review. Download and run their horoscope app. If there are any problems with the pull request, please work with your reviewee to fix this pull request.
