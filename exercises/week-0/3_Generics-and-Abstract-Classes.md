### Morning Exercises

* Create a collection MyCollection which implements the [Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html) interface.
Feel free to be creative with this (if you happen to have a favorite data structure) but it's strongly
suggested that you create MyCollection to be a wrapper around an [array](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html) to create something similar
to [ArrayList<E>](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html).
* Bonus: Implement a binary search tree using the Collection interface. Extra bonus: Implement a type of self-balancing tree, for example a splay tree or a red-black tree.
